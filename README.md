<h1>Files Renamer</h1>
Script developed for Renaming all files on a folder.

This helped me to rename the files on a folder full of images when I was creating the Machine Learning Model for Project Billullo. I used this script to rename all images in the format used in my Jupyter Notebook so I could assign all the labels and data with the correct format and save tons of time and effort.
